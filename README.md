# Paradoxon-Client

## Warning: Experimental Beta!

### How to use the Client:

When you start the installed Paradoxon-Client, a special word is asked that I gave to you when you paid.
After the 2nd login, you can play with it.

Some informations:
Ingame: RSHIFT to open the GUI
Ingame: To toggle unlegit modules, you need to turn on "Unlegits"
Ingame: To structure the HUD, press the Button in the bottom left corner in GUI, then Drag and Drop.
Ingame: Some Modules can have Keybinds, some have color-slider. Just press middle click on the module to access.
Ingame: type in ".help" to get information about every command.


### How to Install / Update:

Download the Installer/Updater, buy a passcode by contacting me via Twitter: @ParadoxonClient
Run the Installer/Updater and the Client gets automatically installed when you don't own it or it gets reinstalled (updated). 

To download the Installer/Updater, go to the "release" section.
