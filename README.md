# Paradoxon-Client

Warning: Experimental Beta!
A 1.8.8 Minecraft version that combines every legit-client with interesting parts of hack-clients and my own ideas.
Paradoxon destroys the metaphorical picture of what is possible to see and do in Minecraft, especially for CWBW.

You will find completely new functionalities, such as "TNTPillar" an enhanced Detector, a beautiful ESP and more.

### CWBW
**Bedwars-Clanwar** is a Minigame on the popular Minecraft-Server [GommeHD.net](gommehd.net).
It's a game where four players fight against four other players.
When you die, you'll respawn, until your bed gets destroyed. As your bed is destroyed, you can't respawn after you've died.
The last standing Team wins.
There are many tactics around this GameMode, such as throwing Ender-Pearls, dropping TNT to your bed or jumping down a MLG-Way.




### How to use the Client:

When you start the installed Paradoxon-Client, a special word is asked that I gave to you when you paid.
After the 2nd login, you can play with it.

Some informations:
Ingame: RSHIFT to open the GUI

Ingame: To toggle unlegit modules, you need to turn on "Unlegits"

Ingame: To structure the HUD, press the Button in the bottom left corner in GUI, then Drag and Drop.

Ingame: Some Modules can have Keybinds, some have color-slider. Just press middle click on the module to access.

Ingame: type in ".help" to get information about every command.


### How to Install / Update:

Download the Installer/Updater, buy a passcode by contacting me via Twitter: [@paradoxon_cw](twitter.com/paradoxon_cw)
Run the Installer/Updater and the Client gets automatically installed when you don't own it or it gets reinstalled (updated). 

To download the Installer/Updater, go to the "release" section.

### For Developer, especially Skids:
This Client is private, even if you would consider reverse-engineering it, it is not done yet and an obfuscation, that will make the skidding of code even harder, will be used when I think the development process is far enough to say that there are many valuable things to steal. 

### Other

WARNING: By using the Installer/Updater, your configs get lost!

WARNING: The Client is written in German, an English version will follow soon.

WARNING: The Client gets updated nearly weekly, so consider to use the Updater more oftenly!
